# Assignment (Static Keyword)

### **1. Why do we need static keyword in Java explain with an example?**

#### In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. Basically, static is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class.

#### Example

```
class LoanFile {
    static double rateOfInterest = 3.24;
    double simpleInterest;
    int principleAmt;

    public LoanFile(int amount, int durationInYr) {
        this.principleAmt = amount;
        this.simpleInterest = (principleAmt * durationInYr * rateOfInterest) / 100;
    }

    double getSimpleInterest() {
        return simpleInterest;
    }

    double getTotalAmount() {
        return simpleInterest + principleAmt;
    }
}

public class StaticDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LoanFile file1 = new LoanFile(10000, 1);
        LoanFile file2 = new LoanFile(20000, 1);
        System.out.println("LOAN FILE 1");
        System.out.println(file1.getSimpleInterest());
        System.out.println(file1.getTotalAmount());

        System.out.println("LOAN FILE 2");
        System.out.println(file2.getSimpleInterest());
        System.out.println(file2.getTotalAmount());
    }
}

```

#### Output

```
LOAN FILE 1
324.00000000000006
10324.0
LOAN FILE 2
648.0000000000001
20648.0
```

### **2. What is class loading and how does java program actually execute**

#### Class Loading

1. Java ClassLoader is an abstract class.
2. It belongs to a java.lang package.
3. It loads classes from different resources.
4. Java ClassLoader is used to load the classes at run time.
5. In other words, JVM performs the linking process at runtime.
6. Classes are loaded into the JVM according to need.
7. If a loaded class depends on another class, that class is loaded as well. When we request to load a class, it delegates the class to its parent.

#### Execution of Java Program

#### The class files generated by the compiler are independent of the machine or the OS, which allows them to be run on any system. To run, the main class file (the class that contains the method main) is passed to the JVM and then goes through three main stages before the final machine code is executed. These stages are:

1. ClassLoader : The main class is loaded into the memory bypassing its ‘.class’ file to the JVM, through invoking the latter. All the other classes referenced in the program are loaded through the class loader.

2. Bytecode Verifier :After the bytecode of a class is loaded by the class loader, it has to be inspected by the bytecode verifier, whose job is to check that the instructions don’t perform damaging actions. The following are some of the checks carried out

   - Variables are initialized before they are used.

   - Method calls match the types of object references.

   - Rules for accessing private data and methods are not violated.

   - Local variable accesses fall within the runtime stack.

   - The run-time stack does not overflow.

   - If any of the above checks fail, the verifier doesn’t allow the class to be loaded.

3. Just-In-Time Compiler : This is the final stage encountered by the java program, and its job is to convert the loaded bytecode into machine code. When using a JIT compiler, the hardware can execute the native code, as opposed to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring the penalty of a relatively lengthy translation process. This can lead to performance gains in the execution speed unless methods are executed less frequently.

### **3. Can we mark local variable as static?**

#### No, In Java, a static variable is a class variable (for whole class). So if we have static local variable (a variable with scope limited to function), it violates the purpose of static. Hence compiler does not allow static local variable.

<br/>

### **4. Why is the static block executed before the main method in java?**

#### The static blocks always execute first before the main() method in Java because the compiler stores them in memory at the time of class loading and before the object creation.

<br/>

### **5. Why static method is also called class method**

#### Static methods are called class methods because, static methods are the methods in Java that can be called without creating an object of class. They are referenced by the class name itself or reference to the Object of that class.

<br/>

### **6. What is the use of static block in java?**

1. The purpose of using a static initialization block is to write that logic inside static block that is executed during the class loading.

2. It is mostly used for changing default value of static variables.

3. It is used to initialize static variables of the class.

### **7. Difference between instance and static variable?**

| Instance variables                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Static variables                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instance variables are declared in a class, but outside a method, constructor or any block.                                                                                                                                                                        | Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block. |
| Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.                                                                                                                             | Static variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when the program stops.                                                    |
| Instance variables can be accessed directly by calling the variable name inside the class. However, within static methods (when instance variables are given accessibility), they should be called using the fully qualified name. *ObjectReference.VariableName*. | Static variables can be accessed by calling with the class name *ClassName.VariableName*.                                                     |
| Instance variables hold values that must be referenced by more than one method, constructor or block, or essential parts of an object's state that must be present throughout the class.                                                                           | There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it.                            |

### **8. Difference between instance and static variable?**

| Static Members                                                     | Non-Static Members                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| They are declared using keyword 'static'.                          | They are declared without using keyword 'static'.                      |
| All objects of a class share the same copy of Static data members. | Each object of the class gets its own copy of Non-Static data members. |
| They can be accessed using the class name or object.               | They can be accessed only through an object of the class.              |
